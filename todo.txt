github actions a la https://github.com/nikolawannabe/aocgen/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-badges.yml

look into some automation to tie AOC_SESSION to github actions secret, or vice versa. maybe leverage the CLI `gp env ...` to set the gitpod variable from the pod terminal.
    github actions secrets prob aren't available to gitpod? set from workspace via script calling the API?

gitpod-recommended VSCode extension `premparihar.gotestexplorer` is apparently not available. do i need a test extension for this project?

figure out how to deal with single-package per year name collisions. EG parseLine() for day 2 & day 3. monkey & monkey21 because monkeys appear often
    this kind of duplicate name is almost guaranteed? how to work around it? parseLine03() is just... ugly
    ha ha ha (or is it ho ho ho). reciever functions on the Day structs. of course. rookie gopher mistake.

get rid of the trailing blank line in the downloaded input file

build/incorporate generic tree type in common

set up so `go test` will check against known answers? (eg in the samples, and refactoring P1 code to get P2 answers without breaking P1)
    should the correct answers be in code, or in text files like the inputs? how to deal with multi-line output like 2022 day 10? (obv, compare the whole long string, but is storing/expressing it more fraught?)
